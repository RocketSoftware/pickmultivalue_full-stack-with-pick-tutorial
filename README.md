# Full Stack with PICK Tutorial

In this *Full Stack with PICK* tutorial, you will learn how to supercharge your PICK development using a modern front end framework ([Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)) and RESTful APIs written in PICK (available for D3, jBASE, OpenQM, Universe and Unidata with [MV Connect](https://www.zumasys.com/products/mv-connect/)). As a bonus, the tutorial includes running jBASE in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container with a free evaluation license to allow you easy and convenient access to a local development environment.

These lessons are designed to appeal to developers of *all* types. Whether you have been using PICK for decades or you are just getting your first introduction, you will walk away from the lessons with a greater understanding of how you can run jBASE in Docker, build REST APIs in PICK and build a front-end Vue.js application that can communicate with those APIs.

> Notes on the technology used:
>
> 1. Docker is a popular and convenient way to run many different environments all from your local system (for development and even production purposes)
> 2. REST APIs are a universal framework for allowing systems to talk with one another
> 3. Vue.js is a popular modern application framework that marries the best of Angular with the best of React
>
> Note on D3, OpenQM, Universe and Unidata: if you would prefer to follow this series on one of these flavors, you can obtain a copy of `MAKE.DEMO.FILE` from [here](https://github.com/pickmultivalue/make-demo-file).

## Repository Information

The code for this repository is broken down into two parts: [back-end](https://github.com/pickmultivalue/full-stack-with-pick-tutorial/tree/master/back-end/) and [front-end](https://github.com/pickmultivalue/full-stack-with-pick-tutorial/tree/master/front-end/). This will allow you to gain a full-stack view of the solution while maintaining an appropriate separation of responsibilities.
