# Full Stack with PICK Tutorial

In this *Full Stack with PICK* tutorial, you will learn how to supercharge your PICK development with:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. REST APIs on [jBASE](https://www.jbase.com/)
3. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

> Note: The REST APIs can also be implemented on other flavors of PICK using [MV Connect](https://www.zumasys.com/products/mv-connect/)

These lessons are designed to appeal to developers of *all* types. Whether you have been using PICK for decades or you are just getting your first introduction, you will walk away from the lessons with a greater understanding of how you can run jBASE in Docker, build REST APIs in PICK and build a front-end Vue.js application that can communicate with those APIs.

## Repository Information

The code for this repository is broken down into two parts: [back-end](https://github.com/pickmultivalue/full-stack-with-pick-tutorial/tree/master/back-end/) and [front-end](https://github.com/pickmultivalue/full-stack-with-pick-tutorial/tree/master/front-end/). This will allow you to gain a full-stack view of the solution while maintaining an appropriate separation of responsibilities.
