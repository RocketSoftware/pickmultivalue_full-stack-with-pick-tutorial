# Setting Up a Simple Vue Environment
In this tutorial we’re going to show you how to set up a simple Vue environment. Vue is a JavaScript front end framework that will allow us to easily interact with the DOM (or html document) After we set up the environment, we’ll run through a simple hello world app example.  
  
**Prerequisites**: minimal HTML and javascript  
  
## Web Editor
Open up your favorite web editor. We use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) for editing, as it has some very handy extensions for modern web development and legacy extensions for Pick as well.  
  
## Create HTML Document
To get started we’re going to create new html document. To do that just click new file (ctrl + n) and paste in a blank document from your favorite source. ([I like w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/))) Be sure it’s saved as .html file type.  
  
## Include Vue with script tags via cdn
Next we’re going to head over to [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/) and directly include the Vue scripts via their cdn (content delivery network). [Click on “Get Started”](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) There you’ll see development and production script cdn addresses. We’re going to grab both and add them to our document's header. For now we’re going to comment out the production version. Open the doc in your favorite browser. Inspect the document and you’ll see Vue consoled *You are running Vue in development mode*. Vue is installed and ready use!
